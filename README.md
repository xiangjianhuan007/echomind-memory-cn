## Acknowledgments

We sincerely thank the authors of the above papers for their pioneering work on self-reflective memory mechanisms. Their research has provided valuable theoretical foundations and inspiration for the design of EchoMind-Memory.skill's Self-Reflective Agent.

The technical design of this project's Self-Reflective Agent benefits from the inspiration of the above groundbreaking research. We extend our sincere academic gratitude to the paper authors.

At the same time, EchoMind-Memory.skill's "self-evolution" primarily differs from the above scientific research in its adoption of **dependency inversion** (core engine with zero LLM coupling), **platform-aware isolation**, and **zero-configuration deployment** — making it directly usable in production Multi-Agent systems without additional infrastructure. This is a production-grade agent application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Check | Install |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Python 3.10+** | `python3 --version` | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| **pip** | `pip --version` | Comes with Python |
| **git** | `git --version` | `sudo apt install git` / [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended, with Auto-Start)

The install script copies files, generates config, and registers auto-start.

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jasonatgit/echomind_memory.skill.git
cd echomind_memory.skill

# Step 2: Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Run the install script
./install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jasonatgit/echomind_memory.skill.git
cd echomind_memory.skill

# Step 2: Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Run the install script
.\install.ps1
```

> **What `install.sh` / `install.ps1` does:**
> 1. Detects your Hermes home directory automatically (priority: `$HERMES_HOME` → platform default)
>    - Linux/macOS/WSL: `~/.hermes`
>    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`
> 2. Copies to `<hermes>/skills/echomind-memory/` (Skill directory)
> 3. Copies to `<hermes>/plugins/echomind/` (MemoryProvider plugin)
> 4. Creates default config `~/.echomind/echomind_config.yaml` (skips if exists)
> 5. *(optional)* Registers HTTP service auto-start — only when `ECHOMIND_HTTP_SERVICE=1` is set
>
> **Rationale:** The EchoMind MemoryProvider plugin runs **inside Hermes's process** —
> no separate HTTP service is needed for memory to work. The standalone HTTP API
> (`main.py`) is only required when integrating with OpenCode, OpenClaw, or other
> external tools that call memory over HTTP.

**Verify after installation:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8005/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok", "version": "1.1.5"}
```

---

### Option 2: Manual Install (No Auto-Start)

If you prefer to start the service manually:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install deps (same as Option 1 steps 1-2)
git clone https://github.com/jasonatgit/echomind_memory.skill.git
cd echomind_memory.skill
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Create config
mkdir -p ~/.echomind && cp echomind_config.yaml ~/.echomind/

# 3. Start the service manually
python main.py
# Service runs at http://localhost:8005
```

> **Tip:** For auto-start, use Option 1 above.

---

### Hermes-Agent Auto Memory (Recommended)

After completing the installation above, activate the MemoryProvider plugin — this enables Hermes to auto-save and auto-retrieve memories on every turn, no LLM decisions required:

```bash
# 1. Install plugin files (already done by one-click install; manual install requires this step)
cp -r echomind_memory.skill/* ~/.hermes/plugins/echomind/

# 2. Activate MemoryProvider
hermes config set memory.provider echomind

# 3. Restart Hermes to take effect
```

**Result:** Every turn auto-saved, auto-retrieved. Self-reflection auto-triggered after conversations — no additional configuration required.

---

### OpenClaw / OpenCode / Claude Code

Install EchoMind to your framework's skills directory, then start the HTTP service:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy to framework skills directory (choose as needed)
cp -r . ~/.openclaw/skills/echomind-memory/    # OpenClaw
cp -r . ~/.opencode/skills/echomind-memory/    # OpenCode

# Start service
python main.py
```

Service runs at `http://localhost:8005`. LLM invokes memory tools based on skill trigger rules.

### Python Quick Start

```python
from main import call

# Store memory (platform-aware)
call("store_memory",
    user_id="alice",
    platform="hermes",
    task_id="task-001",
    context=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are common supply chain coordination models?"}],
    task_status="completed",
    success=True,
)
# Retrieve memory
result = call("retrieve_memory", user_id="alice", query="supply chain coordination models")
for m in result["working_memory"]:
    print(f"[{m['source']}] {m['content'][:80]}")
# Record feedback (AI self-evolution)
call("record_feedback",
    user_id="alice",
    task_id="task-001",
    feedback="positive",
    retrieved_memories=result["working_memory"],
)

# Trigger self-reflection (v1.1.0) — Hermes adapter calls automatically
# Or trigger manually via HTTP: POST /api/reflect
```

---

## Vision

AI is not a tool, it's a collaborator. Collaborators shouldn't have to "re-meet you" every time.

EchoMind enables your AI to:

- Remember your coding style, preferences, and habits
- Remember the bugs you've fixed and approaches you've tried
- Remember the papers and theoretical models you've researched
|- Possess an RL-driven self-optimizing weight system — gets smarter with every interaction
|- This is not a plugin, this is an **AI Multi-Agent Memory Neural Network** with *self-reflective memory*.

## 🚀 EchoMind v2.0 — Chinese Enhanced Edition

> Borrowing the "soul" of Hindsight, wrapping it in EchoMind's "shell".
> Your AI doesn't just "remember" anymore — it **thinks**.

This is a Chinese-enhanced fork of [echomind_memory.skill](https://github.com/jasonatgit/echomind_memory.skill) with a **cognitive architecture-level upgrade** on top of official v1.1.5.

### 🧠 Four-Layer Cognitive Architecture (Crushes Traditional Vector Search)

Most memory systems (including original EchoMind) do only one thing: **store in, search out**. Like a goldfish with short-term memory — it knows you talked yesterday, but has no idea why, what conclusions were reached, or what to do next time.

**EchoMind v2.0 borrows Hindsight's cognitive science architecture, upgrading memory from a "hard drive" to a "brain":**

| Layer | Human Analogy | What It Does |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **🌍 World Facts** | "Fire is hot" | Categorize objective knowledge, trace sources (manual/reflection/observation) |
| **📝 Experience** | "I touched that bright thing and got burned" | Full context + outcome for every interaction |
| **🔍 Observation** | "That bright thing is hot, might be fire" | **Auto-extract patterns from conversations**, like a detective finding rules |
| **🧠 Mental Model** | "Don't touch bright things" | Confirmed observations → **auto-write to system preferences**, permanent |

**This isn't fancy categorization. This is a fundamental leap from "storage" to "cognition."**

### ⚡ Three Core Upgrades

#### 1. Reflection Engine: From "Dead" to "Alive"

**Original problem**: The reflection engine never fired. The code literally said "don't reflect when LLM is available" — like buying a supercomputer and using it as a calculator.

**v2.0 fix**: Three-tier degradation strategy, LLM-driven semantic analysis, auto-triggers a "brain复盘" every 8 conversations.

#### 2. Observation Layer: From "Single Record" to "Pattern Discovery"

New `observation_memory` table (11 tables, up from 9), auto-deduplication, confidence accumulation:

```
First occurrence → "User might prefer concise replies" (conf=0.5, hit=1)
Second occurrence → "Hmm, same pattern" (conf=0.65, hit=2)
Third occurrence → "Confirmed, user likes concise" (conf=0.75, hit=3) → **promoted to mental model**
```

**This isn't coincidence detection. This is pattern recognition.**

#### 3. Mental Model Auto-Sedimentation: From "Session Memory" to "Permanent Persona"

When the same pattern appears **3 times** with confidence **≥0.6**, auto-write to MEMORY.md/USER.md:
- Preferences/rules → USER.md (your habits, remembered forever)
- Knowledge/behavior → MEMORY.md (your hard-won lessons, never repeated)

**What you teach in one conversation becomes a permanent part of your AI.**

### 🆚 Comparison

| Dimension | Original EchoMind | EchoMind v2.0 | Hindsight |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Storage | 9 flat tables | 11 tables + 4-layer architecture | Cloud PostgreSQL |
| Reflection Engine | ❌ Never fires | ✅ LLM 3-tier | ✅ Built-in |
| Pattern Discovery | ❌ None | ✅ observation_memory | ✅ Automatic |
| Mental Models | ❌ None | ✅ Auto-write to files | ✅ Cloud storage |
| Offline | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ API-dependent |
| Deploy Cost | Zero | Zero | ~1GB Docker |

### 🔧 Files Modified (3 core files, 615 lines added)

| File | Change |
|:---|:---|
| `core/_reflective_fallback.py` | 200-line shell → 400-line complete reflection engine |
| `core/storage/sqlite_store.py` | New observation table + source_type migration |
| `adapters/hermes_provider.py` | Reflection loop + mental model auto-sedimentation |

### 📦 Usage

```yaml
# config.yaml
memory:
  provider: echomind
  enabled: true
```

No extra deployment, no Docker, no API key. Change one config line, restart, done.
